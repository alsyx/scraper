# BeautifulSoup Scraper

This scraper is used to fetch data from  [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/).

Then the data is saved to a .csv file for analysis.

## Analysis

To analyse the data I loaded it to the postgres database and used queries to get some insights.

Then I uploaded these queries to the Power BI Desktop and created the visuals.
